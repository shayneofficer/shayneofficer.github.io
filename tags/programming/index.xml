      <description>Motivation I&amp;rsquo;ve always really liked the idea behind websites like wtfjs, gathering together a collection of funny, counterintuitive features of a language to poke some good-natured fun at it. The sentiment is expressed well in its about page:
JavaScript is a language we love despite it giving us so much to hate.
Although I write rarely write JavaScript anymore for my day job, this still mirrors my fondness for the language in the face of (or sometimes due to) all its funny quirks.</description>
